# Import Comic

## Introduction

Venera supports importing comics from local files.
However, the comic files must be in a specific format.

## Comic Directory

A directory considered as a comic directory only if it follows the following two types of structure:

The file name can be anything, but the extension must be a valid image extension.

The page order is determined by the file name. App will sort the files by name and display them in that order.

Cover image is optional. 
If there is a file named `cover.[ext]` in the directory, it will be considered as the cover image.
Otherwise, the first image will be considered as the cover image.

### Without Chapter

```
comic_directory
├── cover.[ext]
├── img1.[ext]
├── img2.[ext]
├── img3.[ext]
├── ...
```

### With Chapter

```
